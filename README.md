<i>Please note that this comparison is only meant to give you a big picture, does not contain all secondary and derived functionalities (free or paid) for each software and might not be a fair representation in every respect as I am not an expert on the alternative apps. I am pretty sure the devs of respective alternatives would feel the comparison is skewed in some way or I did miss an important aspect or unique advantage of the competing solution. For an educated decision you might want to try all apps that offer some sort of trial. If you feel the comparison is not fair, drop me a note a the [BetterDisplay Discord channel](https://discord.gg/aKe5yCWXSp)!</i>

</details>

## Installation

1. Download the [latest version](https://github.com/waydabber/BetterDisplay/releases)
1. Open the DMG file and move the app to Applications folder on your Mac as instructed.
1. Start the app.
1. Use the app menu bar item to interact with the app.

## Usage

A new [User's Guide](https://github.com/waydabber/BetterDisplay/wiki) is under construction (as a GitHub Wiki) to explain all the features of the app - please stay tunded. Until the Wiki/Guide is complete, you can search for answers under [Discussions](https://github.com/waydabber/BetterDisplay/discussions) and the BetterDisplay [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/aKe5yCWXSp) (it has an extensive history, most questions have been asked and answered several times over).

Here are some instructions on how to use some of the most seeked-after features of the app:

### XDR/HDR extra brightness (XDR/HDR upscaling)

With BetterDisplay **you can fully unlock the maximum brightness** of your Apple XDR display as well as your third party HDR capable display. You don't have to do anything special to enable upscaling on supported displays - once you start the app, you can simply use the brightness slider to increase the brightness level beyond 100% to produce up to 1600 nits on your Pro Display XDR. For other HDR displays (in HDR mode), the app automatically sets up the maximum brightness upscaling level taking into account the reported maximum panel brightness.

[For more information on how to use XDR/HDR upscaling, read the wiki entry!](https://github.com/waydabber/BetterDisplay/wiki/XDR-and-HDR-brightness-upscaling)
  
### Fully scalable HiDPI desktop with BetterDisplay using native smooth scaling

Some Macs have issues with custom resolutions. Some macOS versions don't allow sub-4K resolution displays to have HiDPI ("Retina") resolutions even though some 1440p display would greatly benefit from having a HiDPI "Retina" mode. On other Macs the resolution options are too limited. BetterDisplay solves the problem by **unlocking your screens making them fully scalable natively while providing a nice HiDPI resolution slider to freely scale the desktop size**. Also available is the option to create a flexible virtual "dummy" displays that support an unprecedented range of Retina resolutions. You can then utilize this dummy display as a mirror source for your display achieving any HiDPI resolution or for other purposes.

[To read about more on how to set up HiDPI resolutions and flexible scaling, read the wiki entry!](https://github.com/waydabber/BetterDisplay/wiki/Fully-scalable-HiDPI-desktop)

## Discord channel

You can join the discussion on the [BetterDisplay Discord channel](https://discord.gg/aKe5yCWXSp). If you have any issues or questions, don't hesitate to ask!

## Compatibility

- The app is compatible with all Apple Silicon and Intel Macs running macOS Big Sur, Monterey or Ventura.
- XDR/HDR upscaling requires an Apple XDR display (built-in or external) or a natively connected HDR display (VESA DisplayHDR 600 or higher recommended) and an Apple Silicon Mac.
- The display connect/disconnect feature requires an Apple Silicon Mac running macOS Ventura.
- Native Smooth resolution scaling requires macOS Ventura or Monterey 12.4 (or newer) and natively connected displays.
- Maximum Native Smooth scaling resolutions depend on GPU capabilities and the display's resolution (horizontal framebuffer size limit is 6K for M1/M2, 8K for M1/M2 Pro/Max/Ultra - this translates to 3K and 4K horizontal HiDPI resolutions).
- External display hardware backlight control and volume control require DDC capable, natively connected display or an Apple display. Some docks (especially DisplayLink ones) might not support DDC. Software brightness control is available for all displays. All built-in ports of all Macs that can officially run the supported macOS versions are supported for DDC communication (including M2 Pro/Max, M1 built-in HDMI, 2018 Intel mini built-in HDMI). 
- The app is compatible with headless Macs to create custom dummy resolutions for remote access.

## Supporting the development, purchasing BetterDisplay Pro

You can support development by **purchasing a Pro license directly in the app for $15 / €15** (+ Sales Tax or VAT may apply). Just navigate to `Settings` (gear icon) > `Pro` and click on `Buy BetterDisplay Pro`.

[For more information on purchasing Pro, please click here!](https://github.com/waydabber/BetterDisplay/wiki/Getting-a-Pro-License)

### License Terms & Conditions, Refund Policy

Please make an informed purchase decision! The app comes with a generous 14 day unlimited trial (starts when the app is first opened) and several truly useful free features (for personal use only - business users are required to purchase a license) even after the trial is over - this gives ample time and opportunity before a purchase to evaluate the app. Because of this, as a general rule, purchases are final, refund is not available.

For more information on licensing, trial, prices and refund, please read the [License Terms & Conditions and Refund Policy](https://github.com/waydabber/BetterDisplay/discussions/739)!
